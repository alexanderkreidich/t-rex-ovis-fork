# Changelog

Versioned with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Each release is a `vX.Y.Z` Git tag;
installs update only to releases. Remote-PC runtime bundles are versioned separately as
`remote-vN` releases.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A native Mac app, as a trial build for Apple silicon: an AppKit window with the system's WebKit,
  drawn as the installed app is in Chrome, with the bridge inside. It joins the herdr plugin's
  bridge when one runs. CI keeps each build as a download; see [docs/macos.md](docs/macos.md).

### Fixed

- Switching tabs no longer grows the page's memory in Safari and the Mac app: WebKit never frees a
  WebGPU canvas, so each terminal now draws on a canvas a closed one left behind (about 30 MB kept
  per switch before).

### Removed

- The Electron Mac app. 0.1.0's `.dmg` and `.zip` downloads are withdrawn: T-Rex runs as a herdr
  plugin or from a checkout. A release now carries its notes and GitHub's source archives only.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-23

The first release of T-Rex as a product of its own: your herdr sessions in a Ghostty-like
terminal, in a Mac app, a browser or on your phone.

### Added

- T-Rex for the Mac: a `.dmg` for Apple silicon and one for Intel, with the bridge, Bun and Node
  inside. It uses the herdr installed on the Mac, or starts the one it carries.
- The terminal is restty: Ghostty's terminal emulator (libghostty-vt in WebAssembly, drawn with
  WebGPU or WebGL2), with Ghostty's themes, ligatures and cursor styles.
- A Mosh-style state synchronization protocol between the bridge and each window: a slow window
  skips to the latest screen instead of replaying it, and predictive local echo keeps typing
  local on a slow link.
- Minimal chrome: the sidebar lists workspaces, one PC at a time behind a switcher; one top bar
  carries pill tabs; each pane is a card with a title bar, and dragging a card by its title swaps
  it with another. Focus mode lists each workspace's tabs in the sidebar.
- Keys: the command palette on Ctrl+F, a new workspace with a shell in home on Mod+Shift+O, split
  right on Mod+D, the sidebar on Mod+B.
- Installed as a herdr plugin (`alexanderkreidich.t-rex`), T-Rex updates to these releases from
  Settings.

### Removed

From the web client T-Rex began as: the chat view and composer, agent transcript readers, Files
and the file viewer, the Agents list, voice input, the Portal public address, plan meters and the
CLIProxy hub, in-app alert cards and their sound, Markdown rendering, and usage telemetry.
